# pact-contract-test
It is a consumer-Driven Contract Testing which is a form of API testing which truly enables shift left. The contract tool we use is Pact.io, and we will learn about it later in this series of tutorials.

Contract testing is a method to verify integration between two applications independently in order to test what has been passed and see if what is returned matches with the “contract”.


Contract tests fit nicely within a microservice architecture, operating in an agile setting. Therefore examples will be based on the experience that we have gained while working in this environment.
